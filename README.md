# iOS IMAP Notes
This extension allows to edit notes that were created by iOS devices within
Thunderbird.

The legacy version was mostly based on code derived from the extension
"Header Tools Lite" by Paolo "Kaosmos" and OPTO.

The WebExtension version for Thunderbird 115 and later was created with support
from John Bieling.

Thunderbird >121 please use v1.0.4
Thunderbird 115 please use v1.0.1
